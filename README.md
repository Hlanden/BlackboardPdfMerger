# BlackboardPDFMerger
A simple program to take all PDFs from one Blackboard link (from NTNU) and merge them to one PDF. It will merge them in the order that they are uploaded on Blackboard. The program is in early development, and has been made in a "hurry" - Errors can occur...

Currently only tested in Windows.

- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal opened in the cloned folder
